# React Practise repo
This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering the fundamentals of React.js. Here, I work on various mini-projects designed to enhance my understanding of core React concepts, including:

- ***JSX***: Learning how to write and use JSX for creating UI components.
- ***Components***: Building both functional and class-based components to understand Reactâ€™s component-driven architecture.
- ***Props and State***: Managing component data and implementing interactivity using props and state.
- ***Event Handling***: Handling user interactions effectively within components.
- ***Lifecycle Methods***: Exploring the lifecycle of React components and understanding when and how to use different lifecycle hooks.
- ***Hooks***: Utilizing React Hooks like useState and useEffect to build functional components with state and side effects.


Each mini-project in this repository focuses on applying these concepts in practical, hands-on ways. This practice is helping me strengthen my React skills and prepare for building more complex applications in the future.

Feel free to explore the projects and see my progress as I continue to learn and experiment with React!
